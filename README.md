# E12 Value Calculator

For when you want 2 E12 valued resistors, given a ratio between them. It will give you the ideal pair of resistor values. You'll have to include the factors of 10 later. For example, for a ratio of 29, this program would give me resistor pairs that have ratios close to 2.9. You'll have to take into account that extra factor of 10 on your own.
